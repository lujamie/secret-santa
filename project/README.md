Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s
manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly
clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should
be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your
project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions
that you think we might have while testing your work.



# SECRET SANTA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secret Santa is a Christmas gift tradition where members of a group (whether it's friends or family) will randomly
draw names to be designated as someone's "Secret Santa". They are given a wishlist of potential gift ideas to give their
gift recipient. Afterwards, the recipient is supposed to guess who was their Secret Santa.

With that in mind, we created this website, Secret Santa, which simplifies this process through a website.

An interactive website that allows users to register accounts, log in, and confirm an email address in order to use.
Once registered and confirmed, users are able to create a 'party' for other users to join with a party code, and
the site will then randomly generate secret santa assignments for this group of people. This website was designed
to be run as a flask application within the CS50 IDE.
